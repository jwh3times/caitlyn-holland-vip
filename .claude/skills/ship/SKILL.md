description: Ship the current branch — refresh docs, write the CHANGELOG entry for the version this merge will mint, run fast checks, push, and open or update the PR. Use when a feature branch is ready for review, or when the user says "ship it", "open a PR", or "push this".

# Ship

Take the current branch from "code is done" to "PR is open and green-able", and make
sure the changelog names the version this merge will actually create.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the ship skill to open a PR for this branch."

## Why this exists

Every merge to `main` is auto-tagged `v<major>.<minor>.<build>` by
`.github/workflows/version.yml`, where `build` auto-increments. So a branch's changelog
entry must be written for **the version its merge will mint** — an `[Unreleased]`
section is always wrong the moment it lands. Ship computes that version and writes the
entry, and the `Changelog Version` CI job verifies the prediction still holds at merge
time.

All git / gh / script commands in this skill run via the **Bash** tool (git-bash on
this Windows machine), not PowerShell.

## Steps

### 1. Preconditions — stop if any fail

- **Not on `main`.** `main` is protected; work must be on a branch. If on `main`, stop
  and offer to create one (`git checkout -b agent/<topic>`).
- **Clean working tree.** Run `git status --porcelain`. If anything is uncommitted,
  stop and ask the user whether to commit it — do not commit silently.
- **`gh` authenticated.** `gh auth status` must succeed.

### 2. Backfill any undocumented released versions

Compare git tags against `CHANGELOG.md`:

```bash
git fetch --tags -q origin
git tag -l "v*" --sort=v:refname | tail -8
sed -nE 's/^## \[([0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+)\].*/\1/p' CHANGELOG.md | head -8
```

Any 3-part `v<x>.<y>.<z>` tag with **no** matching `## [x.y.z]` section is a released
version with no entry — in practice a merged dependabot PR, which the CI guard exempts.
Backfill it now: read what that tag changed (`git show --stat <tag>`, and the
`package.json` diff for dependency bumps) and add a dated section for it in the right
position. Keep it factual — name the packages and versions. (Legacy 4-part `v1.0.0.x`
tags predate the changelog and are not backfilled.)

This is what makes the bot exemption safe. Skipping it lets the changelog silently lose
versions.

### 3. Compute the target version

```bash
bash scripts/next-version.sh
```

This prints a bare SemVer (e.g. `1.1.6`) — no `v` prefix. It is the single source of
truth; the tag workflow and the CI guard call the same script. Do not compute this
yourself.

### 4. Refresh the docs

Invoke the `docs-updater` subagent, scoped to **this branch's diff only** — not a full
audit:

```bash
git diff $(git merge-base main HEAD)..HEAD --stat
```

Tell it exactly what changed and let it update the docs it owns (CLAUDE.md and
README.md). **You** write the changelog section in step 5 — tell it to leave
`CHANGELOG.md` alone so you don't fight over the file.

### 5. Write the CHANGELOG entry

Insert a section for the target version immediately below `## [Unreleased]`:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

No unreleased changes.

## [1.1.6] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- ...
```

Rules:

- `## [Unreleased]` **stays**, with the `No unreleased changes.` placeholder.
- Date is today, `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Group under Keep a Changelog headings — `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`,
  `Security`. Use **one** heading of each kind per section.
- Describe user-visible behavior and its consequences, derived from the branch diff. Not
  a commit log.
- **Idempotent:** if you already wrote a section for this version on a previous ship of
  this branch, **rewrite it in place** — never stack a second one. If the target version
  changed since last time (someone merged first), renumber the existing section rather
  than adding a new one.

### 6. Fast checks — refuse to push if any fail

Tests, coverage, the production build, and Playwright are **not** run here; CI owns
them. These are the cheap gates that catch most mistakes in seconds:

```bash
npm run format:check
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
```

`npm run format:check` is `prettier --check .` at the repo root, so it already covers
`CHANGELOG.md`, the docs, and the source — there is no separate markdown run. Fix
formatting with `npm run format`. If any check is red, stop and report — do not push.

### 7. Commit the docs and changelog

Only if `git status --porcelain` is non-empty:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "docs: update docs and changelog for v<version>"
```

### 8. Push and open or update the PR

```bash
git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
```

Then check whether a PR already exists for this branch:

```bash
gh pr list --head "$(git branch --show-current)" --state open --json number -q '.[0].number'
```

- **No PR** → `gh pr create --base main` with a title and a body derived from the
  changelog section you just wrote.
- **PR exists** → `gh pr edit <number>` to refresh the body. Do not open a second PR.

### 9. Report

Give the user: the PR URL, the version this merge will mint, and anything the fast
checks or backfill surfaced. State plainly that the build, coverage (80% gate), and
Playwright suites run in CI, not locally — do not imply the branch is verified beyond
the fast checks.

## Do not

- Merge the PR. This repo does not self-merge; ship stops at "PR open".
- Push to `main`.
- Run the build, coverage, or Playwright suites — that is CI's job and it makes this
  skill slow.
- Invent the version number. Always call `bash scripts/next-version.sh`.
